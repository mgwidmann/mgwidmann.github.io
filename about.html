## About

Matt Widmann has been a professional full stack developer for almost 8 years, 6 years in Ruby on Rails, and 2 years in Elixir (as a hobbiest) all against data stores such as MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch. His front-end experience ranges from classical jQuery, Angular 1, React &amp; Redux, to a touch iOS development in Swift and more recently React Native.

RoR experience has been in building RESTful API services and has gone far beyond Rails. Matt has developed everything from full on typical Rails applications (managing 10s of millions of rows), to partial applications using Rails Engines, custom gems, Sinatra applications, Rack applications and everything in between. Throughout Matt's entire career, he has always been a top producer among developers with significantly more experience.

Matt advances his knowledge on a regular basis as a personal hobby and is the reason for his interest in both Ruby and now Elixir. He is described by his peers and superiors as always being very passionate about technology and his work. He takes immense pride in the quality of his work and enjoys solving real world problems.
